# -AWS-Elastic-Beanstalk-Deployment-of-Dockerized-2048-Game

Project Structure

2048 Game:
The project contains the source code for the 2048 game.
The game is containerized using Docker, allowing it to run consistently across different environments.
Dockerfile:
The Dockerfile defines the environment in which the 2048 game runs.
It specifies the base image, installs dependencies, and sets up the application.
Elastic Beanstalk Configuration:
The configuration files for deploying the Dockerized game on AWS Elastic Beanstalk are included.
These files ensure that Elastic Beanstalk correctly builds and runs the Docker container.
Deployment Workflow
Dockerization:
The 2048 game is first containerized using Docker. The Dockerfile is configured to create a lightweight container image with all necessary dependencies.
AWS Elastic Beanstalk:
The Dockerized game is deployed on AWS Elastic Beanstalk.
Elastic Beanstalk manages the provisioning of the underlying infrastructure, including load balancing, scaling, and monitoring.
Environment Setup:
An Elastic Beanstalk environment is created specifically for the 2048 game.
The environment is configured to automatically build and deploy the Docker container.
Deployment:
The Docker image is pushed to the Elastic Beanstalk environment.
Elastic Beanstalk handles the deployment process, ensuring that the application is up and running.
Monitoring and Scaling:
Elastic Beanstalk provides built-in monitoring and scaling features.
The environment scales based on demand and monitors the health of the application.
Prerequisites
An AWS account with permissions to create Elastic Beanstalk environments.
Docker installed on your local machine.
AWS CLI configured on your machine.
Basic knowledge of Docker and AWS Elastic Beanstalk.
